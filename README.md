# I2C_Accelerometer.py

Being part of the McMaster Formula Electric Software Embedded team, I was involved in making a testing module for the serial communnication of the vehicle. In this testing module I worked with two other team members who designed a module for the SPI and UART serial communication. I was responsible for the I2C serial communication. We used object oriented concepts and each made a class for each communication protocal. 

The I2C_Acceleromet.py file is the class which I have designed to read and display the the acceleration of the sensor in the x, y, and z direction for a total of 1 minute. This gives us a lot of data to be compared with the STM32 microcontroller that the team uses for the actual electric vehicle.
